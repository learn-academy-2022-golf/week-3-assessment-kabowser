# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Your answer: JSX is a way for us to write html code in our app.js file while we using create react app. Whatever is in the JSX code block cant be accessed. If you are tring to access a certain javascript variable or function you have to put that variable in {}. The function invocation is a little different as well. The function will be wrapped in <function />

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is a hub of packaged code that contains code from other developers. More specifically it is a package manager. When ran in terminal yarn jest will add the necessary node modules in order to write tests to test our code. We all use yarn when creating react apps. Such as yarn create react-app file-name-student. Once the modules have been "installed"? we are clear to run yarn start which will show us a live local server to see in real time what is happening with our code.

Researched answer: Allows us to add dependencies to our files/ projects. 

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: I have a flash card that I wrote during lecture. I believe an anonymous function is the bare bones of a function such as function functionName = () => {}

Researched answer: Apparently I was wrong. I tried to check w3 school for their definition but was unsuccesful so I just googled it. Anonymous is anonymous because there is no function name! Can only be accessed by a variable it is stored in as a value.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: open source, object-oriented programming language deals large software systems

2. Ruby: open source, object-oriented programming language

3. Implicit return: no return, value of the last line of a method is automatically returned.

4. Ruby blocks: if key word or else starts the block, keyword end is used to specifiy the end scope of code.

5. Ruby hashes: a dictionary container used in ruby that contains helpful and frequently used unique keys and corresponding values.
